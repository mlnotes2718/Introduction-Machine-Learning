    "Development of AI technologies started in the 1950s. The main research areas at the beginning focus on the first 4 categories. The theory of neural network was developed fairly early but its application was limited until recently. Since 2010s with the mature of the Internet and explosion of data, the development of AI technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning, enjoy major breakthrough. The availability of big data allows the development of machine learning and deep learning to advance rapidly, these technologies is now the backbone on most of the modern AI system."

Logic and computing theory forms symbolic AI which focus on knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The mathematics of Markov decision process defined the reinforcement learning. Statistics and probability theory form the basis of probabilistic AI and machine learning. Neural network theory and neural science was combined with machine learning to form deep learning."

Yes, in fact reinforcement theory was combined with deep learning to form a new field called deep reinforcement learning.

Probabilistic AI was also applied in machine learning and deep learning to better deal with uncertainties.  "
