Then we will learn the full machine learning implementation process. After that we will be learning different types of machine learning models. The focus will be on learning the formula of the various model and learn to write own Python code to implement it and then compare it to the open and/or commercial packages. The objective will be understanding the inner workings of machine learning algorithm.\n",
