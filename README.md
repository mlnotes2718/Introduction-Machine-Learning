# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
This repo contains the tutorial of the basics of machine learning. Majority of the content is in Jupyter NoteBook. There are some .py Python files.
This tutorial is my learning notes which is heavily based on the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI. We recreated all the charts and reorganized the content.
Overtime, we have added more details and expanded certain topics from other courses. But the examples and sample data mainly comes from the Machine Learning Specialization course.

The original tutorial is heavily based on the Machine Learning Specialization and earlier Machine Learning Certificate Course offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Univerity. Please checkout the details here. https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/

Additional materials are added from some older Cousera Machine Learning Course from University Of Washington and University of Michigan
